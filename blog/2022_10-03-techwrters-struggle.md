## What Glassdor says?

**Dear Tech Writer Comrades!!**

You know, According to data from Glassdoor, the average salary for a technical writer in India is around INR 4.5 lakhs per year. This is significantly lower than the average salary for an engineer, which can range from INR 6 lakhs to INR 12 lakhs per year.

## What is tech writing?

Technical writing is a crucial part of the engineering process, as it involves creating clear and accurate documentation for complex technical systems and processes. 
You play a vital role in ensuring that this documentation is easily understood by a wide range of audiences, including engineers, technical professionals, and laypeople. Despite this important function, technical writers in India often struggle to earn as much as their engineering counterparts, despite being an integral part of the engineering team.

## Why are tech writers struggling?

One possible reason for this could be that technical writing is not as highly valued or recognized as other engineering roles. Engineers are often seen as the "brain" behind a project, while technical writers are viewed as the "support" team. This can lead to a lack of appreciation for the skills and knowledge required for technical writing, and subsequently, lower compensation. 
As a computer engineer myself who has chosen to pursue my passion for writing, I have experienced these issues firsthand and they continue to be prevalent today.

Another contributing factor could be the lack of a clear career progression path for technical writers. In many organizations, engineers have a clear path to advancement through promotions and higher-level roles, while technical writers may not have the same opportunities. 

This lack of advancement can lead to stagnation in their careers and lower salaries.
In addition, the technical writing industry in India is still relatively young and underdeveloped compared to other countries. This can lead to a lack of standardization in terms of salaries and benefits, resulting in a wide range of compensation for technical writers.

## What can you do?

So what can you do to address these issues and improve their earning potential?

1. Choosing to document cutting-edge technologies and products can be a good way for you to increase your earning potential. By specializing in newer and more innovative technologies, you can demonstrate your expertise and value to potential employers, which can lead to higher salaries.

2. Another strategy for you to improve your earning potential is to focus on accumulating skills and exposure to different sectors, rather than worrying about job security within a single organization. In today's job market, it is not uncommon for employees to change organizations frequently, and technical writers can take advantage of this by seeking out opportunities to broaden their skills and experiences. This can make them more valuable to potential employers and increase their earning potential.

3. During job interviews, it can be tempting to reveal your current salary or be too willing to negotiate down, but you can improve your earning potential by being more assertive and putting your own financial needs first. Instead of revealing your current salary or being too flexible in negotiations, focus on the value you can bring to the organization and the salary range that you are comfortable with. If the employer has a budget that fits your needs, they should be willing to offer it without knowing your current salary. It is important to remember that your salary is not a personal matter, but rather the result of a negotiation based on the value you can bring to the organization.
4. One solution that you should start practicing today is to advocate for your value and contributions within the organization.

5. You can also consider joining professional organizations and networking with other technical writers to stay up-to-date on industry trends and best practices. 

This can help you stay competitive and increase your visibility within the industry.
